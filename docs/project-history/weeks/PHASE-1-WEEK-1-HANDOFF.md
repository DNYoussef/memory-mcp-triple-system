- Environment variable templates
- Deployment settings (Docker, Qdrant, Neo4j, Redis)
- Performance targets (200ms/500ms/2s latency)
- Chunking strategy (Max-Min semantic, 128-512 tokens)

### 3. Drone Task Specifications ✅
Created detailed task files for 3 Drones:

**Task 1**: `week1-task1-docker-setup.md` (backend-dev Drone)
- Docker Compose setup
- CI/CD pipeline
- Health checks
- 4 hours estimated

**Task 2**: `week1-task2-file-watcher.md` (coder Drone)
- Obsidian file watcher
- Embedding pipeline
- Qdrant indexing
- 6 hours estimated

**Task 3**: `week1-task3-test-suite.md` (tester Drone)
- TDD test suite (31 tests)
- Fixtures and builders
- Performance benchmarks
- 5 hours estimated

**Total**: 3 task files (~600 LOC of specifications)

### 4. Coordination Documentation ✅
- `WEEK-1-COORDINATION-SUMMARY.md`: Full week 1 plan
- `PHASE-1-WEEK-1-HANDOFF.md`: This document
- Agent registry validation (confirmed loop2 agents)

## Week 1 Milestones (From Loop 1)

At the end of Week 1, the following must be TRUE:

### Infrastructure ✅
- [ ] Qdrant running at localhost:6333
- [ ] Neo4j running at localhost:7687
- [ ] Redis running at localhost:6379
- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] Data persists across container restarts

### Code Functionality ✅
- [ ] File watcher detects .md changes <500ms
- [ ] Chunking produces 128-512 token chunks
- [ ] Embeddings are 384-dimensional vectors
- [ ] Qdrant indexing completes <2s
- [ ] All functions ≤60 LOC (NASA Rule 10)

### Testing ✅
- [ ] 31 tests written (25 unit + 3 integration + 3 benchmark)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] ≥90% code coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validate <2s latency

### Quality ✅
- [ ] 3-Part Audit passes:
  - **Functionality**: All tests pass
  - **Style**: NASA Rule 10 compliant, type hints, linting
  - **Theater**: No TODOs, no mocks (except in tests), no placeholders

---

## Next Steps (Week 2 Preview)

If Week 1 milestones are met, Week 2 will focus on:

1. **MCP Server** (backend-dev Drone)
   - FastAPI REST API
   - MCP protocol implementation
   - `vector_search` tool
   - Claude Desktop integration

2. **Vector Search** (coder Drone)
   - Semantic search implementation
   - Query reranking
   - Result formatting
   - <200ms latency validation

3. **Testing** (tester Drone)
   - MCP integration tests
   - Multi-model tests (ChatGPT, Claude)
   - Latency benchmarks

---

## Agent Registry Validation

Used SPEK Platform `agent_registry.py` to find optimal Drones:

```python
from src.coordination.agent_registry import find_drones_for_task

# Task 1: Docker setup
find_drones_for_task("Docker Compose pipeline deploy", "loop2")
# → backend-dev (devops is loop3 only)

# Task 2: File watcher
find_drones_for_task("code implement file watcher embedding", "loop2")
# → coder

# Task 3: Testing
find_drones_for_task("pytest tests coverage fixtures", "loop2")
# → tester
```

**All agents confirmed Loop 2** ✅

## Risk Status

**Week 1 Risks** (from Loop 1 Pre-Mortem):

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Docker complexity | Official images, health checks, setup script | Mitigated |
| <2s latency not met | Performance benchmarks Day 1, optimization | Monitoring |
| Model download slow | Bundle in Docker image | Mitigated |
| Tests without code | Detailed specs, TDD examples | Mitigated |

**No P0 blockers** ✅

---

## Success Metrics (Week 1)

| Metric | Target | Validation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Files created | ~23 | Count in src/, tests/, root |
| Lines of code | ~2,370 | Use `cloc` or `wc -l` |
| Tests written | 31 | Run `pytest --collect-only` |
| Test coverage | ≥90% | Run `pytest --cov` |
| Docker services | 3 healthy | Run `docker-compose ps` |
| Indexing latency | <2s | Run benchmark test |
| NASA compliance | ≤60 LOC/function | Run AST analyzer |

## Communication to Queen

**Princess-Dev Report**:
- ✅ Week 1 planning complete
- ✅ 3 Drones ready to spawn
- ✅ All task specifications created
- ✅ Configuration files ready
- ✅ Milestones clearly defined
- ⏳ Awaiting implementation phase

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Drone spawn, monitor progress, validate milestones on Day 7.

**If Week 1 Fails**:
1. Run 3-part audit to identify failure type
2. Retry with different Drone if needed
3. Escalate to Queen if 3 failures

**If Week 1 Succeeds**:
1. Run 3-part audit to confirm
2. Update memory state
3. Proceed to Week 2
