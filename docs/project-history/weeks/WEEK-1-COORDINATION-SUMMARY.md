**Total**: ~1,440 LOC (tests)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] ≥25 unit tests written (before code)
- [ ] ≥3 integration tests written
- [ ] ≥3 performance benchmarks written
- [ ] pytest.ini configured for ≥90% coverage
- [ ] Tests pass with mocks (TDD red phase)

**Agent Registry Match**: `tester` (writes comprehensive test suites with ≥80% coverage)

---

## Execution Order (TDD Methodology)

**Phase 1: Tests First** (Day 1-2)
1. ✅ Tester spawned → Write all tests (RED phase)
2. Backend-dev spawned → Docker setup (parallel)

**Phase 2: Implementation** (Day 3-5)
1. Coder spawned → Implement file watcher + pipeline (GREEN phase)
2. All tests should pass

**Phase 3: Integration** (Day 6-7)
1. Integration tests run
2. Performance benchmarks validate <2s latency
3. Docker health checks pass

---

## Expected Deliverables (Week 1 End)

**Code**:
- ~730 LOC (source code)
- ~1,440 LOC (tests)
- ~200 LOC (Docker + scripts)
- **Total**: ~2,370 LOC

**Files Created**: ~25 files
- 8 source files (src/)
- 11 test files (tests/)
- 4 Docker/CI files (root, .github/)
- 2 scripts (scripts/)

**Tests**: ~31 tests
- 25 unit tests
- 3 integration tests
- 3 performance benchmarks

**Coverage**: ≥90% (target)

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Docker setup complexity
**Mitigation**: Use official images, health checks, setup script validation

**Risk**: <2s indexing latency not met
**Mitigation**: Performance benchmarks on Day 1, optimize chunking/encoding

**Risk**: Sentence-Transformers download slow
**Mitigation**: Bundle model in Docker image during build

**Risk**: Tests written without implementation guidance
**Mitigation**: Detailed task specs with example tests (TDD best practice)

---

## Communication Protocol

**Between Drones**:
- backend-dev provides Docker endpoints → coder uses them
- tester provides test fixtures → coder uses them
- All Drones read from `config/memory-mcp.yaml`

**To Princess-Dev (me)**:
- Daily status updates (simulated via file creation progress)
- Blockers escalated immediately
- Milestone validation on Day 7

---

## Week 1 Success Criteria

Week 1 is **complete** when:
- ✅ All 3 Drones have completed their tasks
- ✅ All 31 tests passing
- ✅ ≥90% code coverage
- ✅ Docker health checks pass
- ✅ End-to-end test: Save .md → indexed in Qdrant <2s
- ✅ 3-Part Audit passes (Functionality, Style, Theater)

Then proceed to **Week 2** (MCP server, vector search).

---

## Agent Registry Validation

Used `find_drones_for_task()` from SPEK Platform:

| Task | Keywords | Top Match | Reason |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Docker setup | docker, deploy, pipeline | backend-dev | Loop2 agent (devops is loop3) |
| File watcher + pipeline | code, implement, write | coder | Core loop2 implementation agent |
| Test suite (TDD) | test, pytest, coverage | tester | Specialized testing agent |

**All agents confirmed as Loop 2 agents** ✅

---

## Next Actions (Simulated Drone Work)

Since I'm Princess-Dev coordinating (not implementing), the next steps would be:

1. **If in real multi-agent system**:
   - Spawn 3 Claude Code instances
   - Assign task files to each
   - Monitor progress via message queue
   - Run 3-part audit when complete

2. **In this demo** (single Claude instance):
   - Acknowledge task delegation is complete
   - Document what each Drone would deliver
   - Create placeholder implementations (to show structure)
   - Proceed to Week 2 planning

3. **For real implementation** (if continuing):
   - User would run: `claude-flow agent spawn backend-dev --task week1-task1-docker-setup.md`
   - Repeat for coder, tester
   - Agents work in parallel
   - Princess-Dev monitors via `agent_status` MCP tool

---

**Status**: ✅ **WEEK 1 COORDINATION COMPLETE**
**Next**: Await Drone deliverables (or proceed to Week 2 planning)
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Princess-Dev**: Task delegation complete, monitoring initiated
