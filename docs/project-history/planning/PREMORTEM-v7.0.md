## Updated Risk Scenarios (v7.0)

### NEW Risk 13: Context Assembly Bugs (Primary Focus)

**Failure Description** (Insight #16): Week 11-14: 40% of production bugs are traced to context assembly (wrong store queried, wrong lifecycle filter, wrong mode detected), not model errors. Users blame "AI is dumb" when actually memory layer is misconfigured.

**Root Cause**:
- Query router misclassifies query (routes to KV instead of relational)
- Lifecycle tags incorrect (session chunks tagged as personal)
- Mode detection wrong (execution query runs in brainstorming mode → no verification)
- No detailed logging to debug (can't replay failed queries)

**Impact**: **MEDIUM-HIGH**
- User queries return wrong results (40% of failures per Insight #16)
- Difficult to debug (no query trace, can't reproduce)
- Users lose trust ("Why is it giving me wrong answers?")
- Team spends hours debugging model when root cause is context assembly

**Probability**: **40%** (High - Insight #16: "Most AI failures are context-assembly bugs")

**Risk Score**:
- Impact: 8 (High, erodes trust and wastes debugging time)
- Probability: 0.40
- **Score: 0.40 × 8 × 100 = 320 points** (CRITICAL if not mitigated)

**Mitigation Strategy**:

**Primary Mitigation** (v7.0 NEW):
1. **Context Assembly Debugger** (Week 14):
   - Log every query: `{query, mode_detected, stores_queried, chunks_retrieved, verification_result, output}`
   - Replay capability: Re-run query with same context (deterministic)
   - Trace visualization: Show decision tree (query → router → stores → ranking → output)
2. **Query Audit Trail**:
   - Store 30 days of query logs (SQLite table)
   - `/debug` endpoint: Return full trace for any query_id
   - Error attribution: Classify failures (context bug 70% vs model bug 30%)
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Dashboard: Mode detection accuracy, retrieval latency, verification pass rate
   - Alerts: Mode detection <85%, verification failure >2%

**Secondary Mitigation** (if primary fails):
4. **Manual Review Queue**: Flag queries with low confidence for human review
5. **A/B Testing**: Run queries against multiple contexts, compare outputs
6. **Fallback to Simple Retrieval**: If complex routing fails, fall back to vector-only

**Residual Risk**: **20%** (Low)
- **Mitigated Score: 0.20 × 8 × 100 = 160 points** (-160 from original 320)
- **ACTUAL v7.0 Score**: 80 points (further optimized via monitoring dashboard)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Context debugger logs 100% of queries (no sampling)
- ✅ Query replay works (deterministic context assembly)
- ✅ Error attribution dashboard shows context bugs vs model bugs
- ✅ Monitoring alerts trigger within 5 minutes of anomaly

---

### NEW Risk 14: Schema Validation Overhead

**Failure Description**: Week 7-14: Schema validation in CI/CD adds 2 minutes to build time (target: <30s). Teams disable validation to speed up builds, breaking schema compliance.

**Root Cause**:
- `MemorySchemaValidator` validates 10,000 chunks sequentially (slow)
- CI runs validation on every commit (100+ commits/week)
- No caching (re-validates unchanged chunks)

**Impact**: **LOW**
- Build time increases 2 minutes (minor inconvenience)
- Teams may disable validation (schema drift risk)
- Not a blocker (acceptable trade-off)

**Probability**: **20%** (Low-Medium)

**Risk Score**:
- Impact: 5 (Low-Medium, slows builds but not critical)
- Probability: 0.20
- **Score: 0.20 × 5 × 100 = 100 points**

**Mitigation Strategy**:

**Primary Mitigation**:
1. **Parallel Validation**: Multi-threaded validation (4 cores → 4x speedup)
2. **Caching**: Only validate changed chunks (git diff detection)
3. **Sampling**: Validate 10% random sample in CI, full validation nightly

**Secondary Mitigation** (if primary fails):
4. **Optional Validation**: Make schema validation opt-in per commit (not mandatory)
5. **Pre-Commit Hook**: Run validation locally before push (shift-left)

**Residual Risk**: **5%** (Very Low)
- **Mitigated Score: 0.05 × 5 × 100 = 25 points** (-75 from original 100)
- **ACTUAL v7.0 Score**: 20 points (parallel validation sufficient)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Schema validation <30s in CI (95th percentile)
- ✅ Caching reduces re-validation 90%
- ✅ Teams do not disable validation (monitored via CI logs)

## Updated Risk Scenarios (Modified from v6.0)

### Risk 1: Bayesian Complexity (v7.0 Improvement: -100 points)

**v6.0 Mitigation**:
- Hard network size limit (1000 nodes)
- Timeout fallback (1s → fall back to Vector + HippoRAG)

**v7.0 ADDITIONAL Mitigation** (Insight #3: Match store to query):
- **Query Router**: Classify query complexity BEFORE querying Bayesian
  - Simple queries ("What is X?") → Skip Bayesian (Vector only)
  - Complex queries ("P(X|Y)?") → Query Bayesian
  - Result: 60% of queries skip Bayesian (no timeout risk)

**Risk Reduction**:
- v6.0: 250 points (timeout fallback)
- v7.0: 150 points (query router + timeout fallback)
- **-100 points** (40% improvement)

**Acceptance Criteria (v7.0)**:
- ✅ Query router skips Bayesian for 60% of queries
- ✅ Timeout fallback tested (automated test with 2000-node network)
- ✅ Average query latency <600ms (vs <1s in v6.0)

---

### Risk 2: Obsidian Sync Latency (v7.0 Improvement: -30 points)

**v6.0 Mitigation**:
- Debouncing (500ms)
- Incremental indexing
- Background queue

**v7.0 ADDITIONAL Mitigation** (Insight #12: Context costs dominate):
- **Hot/Cold Classification**:
  - Hot chunks (accessed daily): Keep in memory cache (Redis)
  - Cold chunks (not accessed 30 days): Compress, archive
  - Pinned chunks (user-marked important): Always in memory
  - Result: 33% less indexing load (cold chunks not re-indexed)

**Risk Reduction**:
- v6.0: 90 points (debouncing + background)
- v7.0: 60 points (hot/cold + debouncing + background)
- **-30 points** (33% improvement)

**Acceptance Criteria (v7.0)**:
- ✅ Hot/cold classification reduces indexing 33%
- ✅ Indexing latency <1.5s (vs <2s in v6.0)
- ✅ Redis cache hit rate ≥80% (hot chunks)

---

**v6.0 Mitigation**:
- Smart suggestions (70% accuracy)
- Batch operations (10 chunks)
- Auto-archive low-confidence

**v7.0 ADDITIONAL Mitigation** (Insight #6: Compression is judgment):
- **Human-in-Loop Brief Editing**:
  - Nexus Processor Step 0: User reviews top-50 candidates
  - User selects top-5 for "brief" (3-sentence summary)
  - User edits brief (preserves critical nuances)
  - Store brief (100 tokens) instead of full 10k-token context
  - Result: 33% faster curation (brief editing faster than chunk tagging)

**Risk Reduction**:
- v6.0: 180 points (smart suggestions + batch)
- v7.0: 120 points (brief editing + smart suggestions + batch)
- **-60 points** (33% improvement)

**Acceptance Criteria (v7.0)**:
- ✅ Weekly curation <25 minutes (vs <35 minutes in v6.0)
- ✅ Brief editing workflow tested (10 user sessions)
- ✅ User retention ≥85% after 4 weeks (vs 80% target in v6.0)

---

### Risk 6: Storage Growth (v7.0 Improvement: -20 points)

**v6.0 Mitigation**:
- Storage monitoring (alert at 80%)
- Auto-cleanup (session memory after 7 days)
- Compression (gzip old networks)

**v7.0 ADDITIONAL Mitigation** (Insight #2: Forgetting is feature):
- **4-Stage Lifecycle with Compression**:
  - Active (100% score): Full text stored
  - Demoted (50% score): Full text stored, decay applied
  - Archived (10% score): **Compressed to summary (100:1 compression)**
  - Rehydratable (1% score): **Lossy key only (1000:1 compression)**
  - Result: 60% storage reduction (vs linear growth)

**Risk Reduction**:
- v6.0: 70 points (monitoring + cleanup)
- v7.0: 50 points (4-stage compression + monitoring + cleanup)
- **-20 points** (29% improvement)

**Acceptance Criteria (v7.0)**:
- ✅ Storage growth <25MB/1000 chunks (vs <35MB in v6.0)
- ✅ Archive compression achieves 100:1 ratio
- ✅ Rehydration success rate ≥90% (lossy keys recoverable)
